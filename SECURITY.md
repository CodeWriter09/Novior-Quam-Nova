# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
As we implemented a update notification in version v3.0.3-release you will automatically get notified if a new version is available, which will include eventual sevurity fixes that are necessary.
Old versions wont get updated, so use them at your own risk, we cannot guarantee that the program will work properly...

## Reporting a Vulnerability
You can simply send us an email to notify us about any security vulnerabilities or bugs in general, we will try our best to get them fixed as soon as possible and release a new and improved version.
